//Purpose: Every Theme has a file called "Theme_Variables.less" which the other files import, including control pack controls.
//         For control pack controls, the "@SourceCode-Runtime-Theme-Variables-File" is automatically injected at compile-time,
//         by smartform's less compiler, and will contain a path to this file. Please see "SPEC: Controls LESS Theming" for details.
//Rules:   This file should *ONLY* generated css variable declarations. It should not have any "color, margin, border, font" 
//         or any other standard properties once compiled.


// All LESS Variables are defined as CSS Variables here
// Custom controls will @import this file to gain access to these variables (using "@SourceCode-Runtime-Theme-Variables-File")
// Basic controls  will have access to these variables as Theme.less @imports this file at the top.
// e.g.
// @Input-Background-Color: --input-background-color;
// @Input-Border-Color: --input-border-color;
// 350 more!
// @Button-Background-Color: --button-background-color;
